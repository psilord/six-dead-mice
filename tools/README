These tools are here to help automatically reset the BBB and to boot a raw
image over its serial connection.


bbb_reset uses the GPIO pins on a master BBB and some custom hardware
I made to reset a slave BBB upon which I'm testing the code.

bbb_boot uses sx and the XMODEM-CRC protocol to download the _initial_
kernel image to the BBB.
