These tools are here to help automatically reset the BBB and to boot a raw
image over its serial connection. However, there must be human intervention the
first time to hold the POW_BUT down when applying power to get the BBB into
the "boot from USB, then serial" state. Once there, the bbb_reset tool will
leave it in that state over reboots.


bbb_reset uses the GPIO pins on a master BBB and some custom hardware
I made to reset a slave BBB upon which I'm testing the code.

bbb_boot uses sx and the XMODEM-CRC protocol to download the _initial_
kernel image to the BBB.  kermit was unstable, this seems to not only
work better, but also much faster. One still uses kermit to connect
to the booted machine though.
